This is a model made for Kaggle's [Statoil/C-CORE Iceberg Classifier
Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/statoil-iceberg-classifier-challenge).

Please make sure to install everything in requirements.txt with pip3 using
```bash
pip3 -r requirements.txt
```

The model itself is defined in `model.py`. To train the model, run
```bash
./train.py
```
replacing the variables with the proper values.

It uses Python 3.

The data files are too large to store on GitHub, so please download them from
Kaggle. We will supply a pretrained model once we find something that works.
