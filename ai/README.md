# ASSIST AI

This is the AI powering ASSIST. It is based on a neural network.

To use it, call the	`probability_of_survival` function in `bin/prognosis`.

Do **NOT** interact with the AI by directly calling a file in `src/`. These
files may change name or structure, which can break other parts of the code.
Instead, always only use files in `bin/`, which are much more stable.
